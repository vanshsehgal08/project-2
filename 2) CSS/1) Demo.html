    <h3>Themes</h3>
    <p>Themes
        The original Iron Man title explored Cold War themes, as did other Stan Lee 
        projects in the early years of Marvel Comics. Where The Fantastic Four and The
        Incredible Hulk respectively focused on American 
        domestic and government responses to the Communist threat, Iron Man explored industry's role in the struggle.
